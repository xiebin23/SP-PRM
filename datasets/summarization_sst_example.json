I didn't want to insist since it seems like she doesn't enjoy sports in general.\n\nIs there anything simple and fun we can do in a town where there is nothing much to see? I'm also looking for something that doesn't necessary cost something.\n\nShe enjoys dance, jogging, cooking, reading, movies and musics (she plays a few instruments). I thought about asking her to show me a few moves (dance) or cook something with me but I feel like it may not be fun for her.",

This girl has it all the body, brains, personality, and genuine caring atitiude you look for in a girlfriend,did I mention shes a personal trainer, so she even has the brawn that I require as well. It was love at first sight we completely clicked, and I found myself desperately searching where she was when she wasn't beside me. This was supposed to spring break vacation. But I caught feelings hard, as did she!  \nWe both bond over working out which is fine, I absolutely love that about her, but and honestly I feel this is the only but in this relationship. She trains exes and/ or trains with exes who take her videos or photos. We both live in Canada but are miles away, exactly a 7 hour flight unfortunately regardless though I plan on visiting her next month. I know what all my friends and co-workers are saying ( HEY MAN WAKE UP THIS WONT WORK) but something in my heart and intuition tells me she is the one. Is this possible to make this  work and do you think its possible to suppress this jealous feelings of all these muscle bound dudes, some of them exes and or sexual partners, spotting and taking pictures of my girl friend.\n\nAlso we pretty much are in contact through facetime throughout the day so, No I don't believe she is cheating but I cant help but feel some sort of way. any help redditors would be greatly appreciated!!",

The only thing was she wasn't looking for a serious relationship, which was okay with me.\n\n    Yesterday, after we went out for the day, I had to leave to finish some school work. I tell her later that I had a good time, but she says I can't be what she expects me to be and that her ex was \"her person\" and she threw him away. She can hardly sleep out of fear of dreaming about him. I try to comfort her, but she listens to very little of it. She can't go back to her ex because of how badly their relationship ended and it depresses me to see her like this. I don't know if she feels this way because I reminded her of her ex or if she's just depressed (she does take medication as she often has panic attacks too). I don't know if I'm digging myself into a bigger hole by talking to her about it, but she doesn't have anyone else to turn to besides her parents.

We've asked him several times after reasonable hours (12AM on Monday etc.) to turn down the music so that it's not shaking our rooms, but every time we've done this he's been too drunk to understand what we're talking about and refuses anyway.  We are also two girls in our early twenties and he is a man in his 40s and he's pretty intimidating.  In the past week, the cops have been called on him twice: once for smoking weed with his door open and once because he turned on his concert speakers and left them playing all night long (the cops came at 6 AM and broke down the door).\n\nThe landlord seems to want to help us, but according to him, the laws are such that it is nearly impossible to evict him (despite the fact that he is directly violating the apartment contract) unless we constantly record his disruptions.  The psycho has run off two previous tenants.  The landlord even offered to buy us a decibel measuring device.  We are meeting with the landlord on Tuesday to discuss taking the tenant to court.\n\nWe really really love the apartment and everything else about it is perfect (including everyone else in the building who we like and also hate this guy).

The psycho has run off two previous tenants.  The landlord even offered to buy us a decibel measuring device.  We are meeting with the landlord on Tuesday to discuss taking the tenant to court.\n\nWe really really love the apartment and everything else about it is perfect (including everyone else in the building who we like and also hate this guy).

We are really sad that we have to start looking at apartments again, but the current situation is unbearable.\n\nDoes Reddit have any advice on how we can stay in this heavenly apartment and help everyone else in the building by getting this guy to turn down his music?",

It was a snowy day in Vermont, and a car took a turn WAY too fast and t-boned me in my car.\n \nThe police came, and the driver didn't have a license, registration, or insurance (in VT insurance is mandatory). Police ran his name, filed the report, sent him on his way. Turns out he didn't have insurance AT ALL (even though he is a delivery driver hired by a national pizza chain).\n \nMy car was towed, I had to pay my deductible even though he was found at fault, I had to drive a rental, miss work, etc etc.\n \nI've tried contacting the managers of the store, they are insane. They will be super nice at first, say they will follow through, and then when they inevitably don't, I come back a week later or call and they get all hostile.\n \nThis has been going on for SEVEN MONTHS. I've even tried talking to their customer service line on twitter. They keep saying they have contacted the managers of the store and they will contact me, but as you guessed, they never do.\n \nI'm getting really fed up. All I wanted was my deductible back but now they've pissed me off.\n \nWhat are my options here? Should I get a lawyer? Take them to small claims for just my deductible? Go after the individual that hit me and has been dodging my insurance collectors? Go after the company? Could I possibly sue for more than my deductible since its pretty negligent to have someone out delivering for you without insurance, registration, or license..?",

Side by side, 8 deep! I fly over 100 times a year, but I'd never seen anything like this - a human traffic jam caused by 8 oblivious idiots. 8 obliviots.\n\nMore than two dozen people and an airport cart driving an elderly woman frustratedly walked behind them. They ignored people's polite requests of \"excuse me\", angry pleas of \"I have a flight to catch!\" and even the beeping of the cart. And this was not a mall or a park - this was an airport, where delaying someone else by even a minute can destroy their day. \n\nMeanwhile, they loudly gabbed about what cute boys they liked - as if sticking to script from an Archie comic.

We've all known each other forever; it's not weird. Anyway..\n\nA month or so ago I went to a party with a few friends at one of their older brother's houses. We were all hanging out having a good time when a guy who I knew casually walked up to me. We started talking, and before we knew it, we had been chatting it up for nearly an hour and a half. We exchanged numbers and continued to talk. Now, we text each other constantly, and I can't get him out of my head. It amazes me how much we have in common, and it's so easy for him to put a smile on my face. Last weekend, I gave him a ride home from a get together, and while we were sitting in front of his house, he looked at me and said \"This is bad..\" I questioned his statement, and he told me he's falling for me. He told me that he wants to start spending more time with me, and that he doesn't want me to think he's trying anything scummy. (I'm assuming this was to reassure me because he's a notorious lady's man, and is known to get over on girls pretty easily) But, we've been talking for about a month and a half, and we haven't hooked up at all. He seems like an honest and genuine person, and it's hard for me to imagine where all the rumors about him have come from. Here's the most difficult part... he's twenty-two. From what I can tell, he's more mature and more down to earth than most of the guys my age, and the only downfall is the five year gap.. If he was really just trying to get in my pants, why would he have waited this long? He's incredibly attractive and could easily have any girl he wanted, but instead he's been sticking around.\n\nSo Reddit, am I being stupid by even thinking about pursuing this?

We've all known each other forever; it's not weird. Anyway..\n\nA month or so ago I went to a party with a few friends at one of their older brother's houses. We were all hanging out having a good time when a guy who I knew casually walked up to me. We started talking, and before we knew it, we had been chatting it up for nearly an hour and a half. We exchanged numbers and continued to talk. Now, we text each other constantly, and I can't get him out of my head. It amazes me how much we have in common, and it's so easy for him to put a smile on my face. Last weekend, I gave him a ride home from a get together, and while we were sitting in front of his house, he looked at me and said \"This is bad..\" I questioned his statement, and he told me he's falling for me. He told me that he wants to start spending more time with me, and that he doesn't want me to think he's trying anything scummy. (I'm assuming this was to reassure me because he's a notorious lady's man, and is known to get over on girls pretty easily) But, we've been talking for about a month and a half, and we haven't hooked up at all. He seems like an honest and genuine person, and it's hard for me to imagine where all the rumors about him have come from. Here's the most difficult part... he's twenty-two. From what I can tell, he's more mature and more down to earth than most of the guys my age, and the only downfall is the five year gap.. If he was really just trying to get in my pants, why would he have waited this long? He's incredibly attractive and could easily have any girl he wanted, but instead he's been sticking around.\n\nSo Reddit, am I being stupid by even thinking about pursuing this? Is this guy just taking advantage of a naive 17 year old with his looks and charm, or do you think he's really into me?",

We're both sophomores in highschool and recently have hit a rough patch in our relationship. She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last summer and then was admitted into a psychiatric hospital in our city. After she got out, she was always depressed and the medication she was taking didn't appear to help, but I always managed to cheer her up. Her depression faded away for a while around October-November up until about a month go when it started affecting her more often. Since then we've had more arguments come up because of it messing with our relationship.\n\nShe went to her psychiatrist last week and she recommended that we take a break, which we didn't end up doing. Then this morning during class she sent me a message saying that she, \"can't take it anymore!\" and some other stuff saying how she wants to take a break because things weren't working out. Right before lunch she sends me another message saying, \"You know I still love you right? I always will\". I told her to leave me alone because I wanted some time to think about what to do. After school I messaged her asking if she wanted to take a break or break up completely. She couldn't make up her mind so I told her tell me in a couple days. So right now we're currently on a break. I don't know if I should move on or wait for her. Like as in if she only wants a break, should I wait it out, or move on? Or if she wants to break up, should I move on, or try to win her back (again)? She's my first girlfriend ever, and we've been through so much together and I absolutely love this girl with all of my heart to the point where we've discussed getting married many times, but now I don't know what to do. Any advice helps and ask me questions if you need more details.",

        "content": "So me and my girlfriend have been dating since December 18, 2011, so a little over a year now. We're both sophomores in highschool and recently have hit a rough patch in our relationship. She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last summer and then was admitted into a psychiatric hospital in our city. After she got out, she was always depressed and the medication she was taking didn't appear to help, but I always managed to cheer her up. Her depression faded away for a while around October-November up until about a month go when it started affecting her more often. Since then we've had more arguments come up because of it messing with our relationship.\n\nShe went to her psychiatrist last week and she recommended that we take a break, which we didn't end up doing. Then this morning during class she sent me a message saying that she, \"can't take it anymore!\" and some other stuff saying how she wants to take a break because things weren't working out. Right before lunch she sends me another message saying, \"You know I still love you right? I always will\". I told her to leave me alone because I wanted some time to think about what to do. After school I messaged her asking if she wanted to take a break or break up completely. She couldn't make up her mind so I told her tell me in a couple days. So right now we're currently on a break. I don't know if I should move on or wait for her. Like as in if she only wants a break, should I wait it out, or move on? Or if she wants to break up, should I move on, or try to win her back (again)? She's my first girlfriend ever, and we've been through so much together and I absolutely love this girl with all of my heart to the point where we've discussed getting married many times, but now I don't know what to do. Any advice helps and ask me questions if you need more details.",

[Here is the first post] and [the update] I am still going to refer to my husband as P, for simplicity.\n\nI will keep this short, but I just wanted to let you all know that your kind words and advice have helped me out enormously.\n\nI am now 17 (I turn 18 in 2 months) and P turned 18 a few months ago. In July, my aunt moved back to Canada because she was offered a teaching position at a private school. P and I went with her and all three of us are renting a small house. P and I both applied to the local college together. I am currently taking classes for my high school diploma and am about to graduate this month :) P is studying engineering.\n\nI got a job at a daycare and I love it. I love working and making my own money. I am saving up for a car right now. \n\nSince moving to the US, both P and I have not focused on religion. We haven't been to the temple and have 'forgotten' to pray and dress modestly. I say this because the first thing I did with my first pay check was to go to the mall and buy some lingerie. My style has definitely changed and is more mature/more mainstream. P was never as focused on religion as much as I was, so this suits him just fine.\n\nWe decided to hold off on legally marrying until we have both graduated college. I also went and got on birth control, so no risk of having babies. We plan to wait until we have a house and jobs before trying for kids.\n\nAnyway, I took all of your advice to heart. I didn't rush into anything, I got birth control, we returned to a 1st World Country. We got away from my religious parents (they are lovely to me, but I need to make my own choices).\n\nThank you all so much!",

I liked her and she liked me, but she didn't want to be in a relationship. She said it was because she didn't want to get hurt in the longrun. Also, it was pretty early on so it was understandable to take things slow.\n\nWe don't have much in common. But the times I've spent with her make me feel like she was still into me. What makes me feel like she isn't interested in me is that whenever I'd ask to see her again, she would put it off to another day, and it's been about a week now. I have a feeling she's seeing other guys as well but I have no concrete proof and that could just be me overreacting.\n\nI think it may be me being too emotional over a casual relationship, or being too 'clingy'. I've talked to her about this in the past and she claims it's because she's just not as emotional in nature.\n\nI've been very disturbed by this situation in the past couple days, and could really use some people to talk to. If I haven't provided enough details about the relationship, feel free to ask. Any help is much appreciated.",

Some days he's pretty good, some days he's not so good - all to be expected. I've read a lot about training loose leash walking and most of it is geared towards a dog pulling. My pup, he pulls a lot. But also, just as often, we'll get walking and he'll just sit and not want to move. We've been working on the \"Let's Go!\" command, but just as often as he'll respond to it, he won't. I don't want to pull him - currently we are using a standard flat collar, but I'm wondering what techniques I should be using in this situation? We'll be walking along, with him slightly behind me and then he'll stop dead in his tracks and the leash is taut, with him a couple feet sitting behind me.

Throughout the last couple months, we have continued to do so without A's knowing. It had gotten to the point where I would be going upstairs and sleeping in his bed with him. Z's attitude hasn't changed towards me even though we have slept together several times. Though, I felt more and more attracted to him as the weeks went on.\n\nI have recently moved into a place and feel as though I should in some way tell him that I have feelings for him. I'm just not sure how, because we always act like we're just \"buddies\" and it's kind of killing me inside. (ex: calling each other dude, or man) ALSO: I asked him if he wanted to do something awesome for Valentines Day, he said sure if he doesn't get called into work.\n\nSo the advice I am looking for is, **how can I tell Z that I am really into him? Should I do it in person? If so, where or when? Do I randomly bring it up in conversation? What if I get rejected?** Please help! :( I'm such a pussy.",

It's driving me mad because when I say something's wrong, I don't do it to nag, but I want to hear his side and I want to be insured that he actually listened to me.\n\nOne very recent example: I told him yesterday that I need him to communicate with me more often during the day. I did it via text, unfortunately, because we won't be seeing each other until tomorrow and it's been bugging me. He didn't react, then, this morning, he send me a funny picture, to, quote \"lighten up the mood\" unquote. I know he will not address my text. He will be better about texting for a few days/weeks, then it will be back to normal. It's driving me up the wall because I don't feel taken seriously, but I can't really address this without sounding like \"I demand that you admit you were at fault and apologize\", which is not what I want.

So about 2 months ago, we had a threesome with some girl. Shortly after that night, I started getting symptoms for an STD and went and got tested by my gynecologist, who is also a family friend of my mom's. I got tested by him because around here you can spend hours upon hours in clinics, whereas with him I'm in and out in a matter of minutes. So anyway, sure enough, I test positive for a very treatable STD. I'm a little annoyed but I don't really think about it too much. But when my doctor came in, he starts telling me that \"this is a time where you find out what your partner is really like\", and then starts lecturing me that I'm with some scumbag asshole. I don't really want to tell him that I had a threesome because he's almost like family to me, but he goes on and on and on about this, super condescendingly, and then keeps pushing me to move out of my place and go back to my parent's. I told him that I knew he didn't cheat on me and I know where this STD stems from, but he just dismissed that and proceeded to lecture me more. \n\nI left the office visibly annoyed but told my bf I tested positive, so he went and got tested as well (at a separate clinic) and got meds for it. My doctor told me that I have to get tested the following month to make sure I'm clear and I'm really dreading this appointment. I feel like doctors aren't allowed to judge me like that and he's making me feel dirty...

        "content": "This post may be TMI but anywho. I've been with my boyfriend about a year and we live together. Our relationship is great, and we're very open sexually. So about 2 months ago, we had a threesome with some girl. Shortly after that night, I started getting symptoms for an STD and went and got tested by my gynecologist, who is also a family friend of my mom's. I got tested by him because around here you can spend hours upon hours in clinics, whereas with him I'm in and out in a matter of minutes. So anyway, sure enough, I test positive for a very treatable STD. I'm a little annoyed but I don't really think about it too much. But when my doctor came in, he starts telling me that \"this is a time where you find out what your partner is really like\", and then starts lecturing me that I'm with some scumbag asshole. I don't really want to tell him that I had a threesome because he's almost like family to me, but he goes on and on and on about this, super condescendingly, and then keeps pushing me to move out of my place and go back to my parent's. I told him that I knew he didn't cheat on me and I know where this STD stems from, but he just dismissed that and proceeded to lecture me more. \n\nI left the office visibly annoyed but told my bf I tested positive, so he went and got tested as well (at a separate clinic) and got meds for it. My doctor told me that I have to get tested the following month to make sure I'm clear and I'm really dreading this appointment. I feel like doctors aren't allowed to judge me like that and he's making me feel dirty... I don't really want to ditch him and not go to him anymore because it's pretty fucking convenient to have a doctor available whenever you need it. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation?",

I constantly hear others talking behind his back and making comments about him. We go out to the club regularly and his clothes are usually sloppy, he has low self confidence and he feels that he isn't good at anything (which is not true he is an awesome person). He is oblivious to sarcasm and he doesn't understand when people are making fun of him right in his face. I don't get that much female attention, however, I get way more than he does. He has the retarded belief that most women will never find him attractive, he's not a bad looking guy either. I have suggested the idea of shopping with him to help him buy new clothes, teaching him how to dance better and giving him social tips. I keep trying to tell him that deep down inside of him there is a suave Barney Stinson like guy that's dying to get out, but he doesn't believe it! He just has to bring him out. I will reiterate that he will always be my friend for life, but I know that since we are always together, people always associate us with one another.

We go out to the club regularly and his clothes are usually sloppy, he has low self confidence and he feels that he isn't good at anything (which is not true he is an awesome person). He is oblivious to sarcasm and he doesn't understand when people are making fun of him right in his face. I don't get that much female attention, however, I get way more than he does. He has the retarded belief that most women will never find him attractive, he's not a bad looking guy either. I have suggested the idea of shopping with him to help him buy new clothes, teaching him how to dance better and giving him social tips. I keep trying to tell him that deep down inside of him there is a suave Barney Stinson like guy that's dying to get out, but he doesn't believe it! He just has to bring him out. I will reiterate that he will always be my friend for life, but I know that since we are always together, people always associate us with one another. I know shouldn't care what other think, but I feel like an asshole because I feel embarrassed being with him at times. He is my friend and all I want is for him to be happy. He is too good of a human being for people to be thinking that he is a loser. They should be talking bad about me instead. What do I do about this situation? How do I help my friend \"come up to my level\" and possibly surpass me? For those that have been in the same place as me, what did you do?",

I made the decision to try and rekindle, leaving my job and friends and family, after discussing it at length with her, jumped on a plane to America with high hopes. \n\nIt hasn't gone great, she is working 6 days a week, I cant work because I don't have the proper visa. The obvious next move was to figure out how to get a visa, her parents are lawyers so they found us a lawyer and tried to set up contact. My SO quickly seemed to lose interest and has done borderline nothing to progress with this. I currently have ten days left on my visa, flights are booked back to Australia.\n\nEarlier this week before she left for work, I told her we need to talk about what's happening with my life, whether we are going to work together to try and figure out how/if I can stay here and whether I should come back or not. She brushed it off. Came home that night at 3:30 am drunk, and went straight to sleep. In the morning, I again told her that we need to figure it out before she left for work. She came home again, absolutely wasted. We got into a huge fight, not just a petty argument, a huge fight, things were thrown, she hit me in the face and I have a bruise on my neck. I don't know what to do. Am I in deep enough to consider trying to work it out? Or do I throw in the towel and go home tail between my legs?\n\njust to clarify:\nI love this girl, we usually get on like a house on fire, but under pressure like this, things get tense.",

Not wistfully; I don't have feelings for him anymore; I've realized that a lot of things about our relationship that I thought were normal at the time were actually super unhealthy. But every day I'll see something that will make me think, \"oh, I remember when Ex and I...\" or \"Ex would probably like/not like this\" or \"if Ex was here he would probably say...\" It's seriously driving me crazy. I have no desire to have this person back in my life but these relatively innocuous thoughts keep popping up. At this point it's so bad that I have an automatic association between my ex and intrusive thoughts, so that if I think about intrusive thoughts it turns into \"just like how I keep thinking about my ex\". It's absurd and feels immature, not to mention unfair to my boyfriend, who is an incredible guy and without a doubt the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.\n\nI guess it's really bothering me because while I was in the throes of the breakup all my friends were telling me \"you'll just wake up one day and realize you haven't thought about him for weeks!\" and I kind of set that as my benchmark for being over it. I don't think I've even made it past sunset without having him pop into my head somehow, let alone multiple days. It just seems and feels really unhealthy.",

The time difference is 9 hours and her WiFi is choppy at best, but we still find roughly a half-hour to an hour a day to talk.

She gets back on the 10th of November.\n\nThanks.",

After that relationship ended, I put off dating for a little awhile. I turned down multiple girls, and felt proud of myself. For once, I was content being single...\n\nThen I met the latest girl. I was hesitant to give her much romance and love, but after about 6 months, I started to cave. I really started to love this girl and trusted her - something I hadn't given anyone since my first girlfriend at 17. Unfortunately, just a few days after this past Christmas, she came home from out of town in a crying, scared mess. She was honest & admitted she had cheated while back in her hometown over the break. Long story short, we broke up.\n\nCurrently (past two weeks), I've been seeing a counselor to help better myself. I've never felt more confident that I'll be a stronger, better man in the future. But I'm also scared... I fear that I won't be able to trust anyone for a very long time. So, I ask of you, those of you who have been cheated on, how are you able to trust others again?",

Before even introducing or even talking with her, I saved her from being hit on by a lesbian by pretending to be her boyfriend and asking her out for a cigarette. Went off without a hitch and we ended up talking outside for about 45 minutes and exchanged numbers. From that moment on we talked/texted at least once a day always asking how each others day was and exchanging witty banter. She was going back home for Christmas on the 21st of December and had a flight that morning at 8am. She asked me if I wanted to spend the night and we did. We had beyond amazing sexy time and stayed up until she had to leave for her flight. While she was away we talked all the time, confessing we missed each other etc etc. When she came back we resumed right where we picked up. Over the last 10 days or so though, something seems to have changed drastically. Now I am a chronic over analyzer, and I have been in a lot of relationships where if I didnt talk to my girlfriend of either 2 months or 2 years for a day because of whatever reason, it didnt bother me. With this girl though, its very different. I feel like I found someone truly special and dont know if im just acting differently because of it. Also, I am afraid to ask about the drop off of the last 10 days or so. We havent seen each other in that time period, and when I ask her if she wants to do something, there is something business related that hinders the plans. \n\nReddit help, I honestly think this is a special one, and I dont want to screw it up. I am sorry if this stream of thought is hard to read. If you have questions dont hesitate to ask.",

I would often travel to the US as my mom lives there and we would see eachother. When we'd see eachother, I would always be overjoyed to see him from the moment I would lay eyes on him at the airport to when we were snuggling in bed. Even when we weren't physically together, I felt huge attachment to him. We'd play games and owt together and everything just felt right. I truly thought I needed him in my life and it scared me but I loved him truly.\n\nI arrived to America one day and he told me that he'd been in the hospital. He told me he had an MRI done and it shows he had a small brain mass. I was scared, I didn't think this was truly happening. For a while I was supportive, but his anxiety made him more and more ill about the situation and it was destroying me to know he was in such shambles. I remember asking him where my confident boyfriend went...\n\nIt took its toll on me, so when I arrived back to England, I decided to get a job in Edinburgh. I always loved Scottish accents and Edinburgh so I figured it'd make me happier, and it did. I joined a gaming society, moved into a flat, got a job and made new friends. Little by little I hid from JJ, finding sanctuary in all my new hobbies and friends till eventually he got sick of trying to contact me and switched his FB relationship status to Single. \n\nShould I feel guilty? I'm a happier person now because of it. I e-mailed him before the holidays and he said he's doing great but said he had no interest in being friends with someone he still loves. I understand. But I hope he understands why I ran. I'm a happier person because of it...\n\nShould I truly feel guilty for what I've done?",

Last night he came to bed while I was still on my laptop and he asked what I was doing so I thought it was a good opportunity to show him what I found. I was really polite I thought and really emphasized how concerned I was about it. He blew me off and said he was going to sleep. Fine, I let him. I thought maybe he'd be more open about it in the morning and was probably tired anyway.\n\nWell, in the middle of the night I woke up and he smelled HORRIBLE! It made me so mad because he doesn't even listen to me. I got up to use the bathroom and when I got back into bed I yanked over the blanket. He asked me what was wrong and I told him that I tried talking to him this evening about something important and he was being immature about it. We got into an argument and then I told him he smelled so I was sleeping on the couch. I did. He left for work this morning without saying anything.\n\nI know I shouldn't have done that but he's being so stubborn! I've been very patient. I collected information so he can read it and so we can work something out together. \n\nWhat should we do? Break up over bad breath?",

But it feels like I don't have anyone to talk to about it anymore.\n\nPerhaps I am being dramatic, but I often find that I just straight up hate myself. I'm often excluded when my friends do something together, so I've basically cut off a decent chunk of my friend group since this kept happening and I was feeling worse and worse. That leaves me with not very many people in my life that I truly enjoy spending time with, and I am worried that my constant negativity will drive them away as well.\n\nI just want some advice on how to start feeling better about myself and how to not worry about other people. I work out regularly, I'm going to a great school, and I think in general I have some good things going for me. But I can't appreciate them, because I focus on the faults and how so-and-so is doing much better. \n\nAny advice would be helpful. Thank you to those who read all the way.",

I'm so confused.\n\nI do feel like I was starting to lose myself in the relationship so I have been taking steps to do things for me and get involved in activities. I just love this guy so much. I'm so hurt and confused. Since all this, I've pulled back and spent more time on me. Strangely enough, my boyfriend is more complimentary than ever but it feels like there's a wall between us now.",

We're both from opposite ends of US so weren't able to meet but we skyped almost daily.

I got to the stage where I knew her completely as a person, and she knew me too. I thought she was my soulmate. I knew she was having issues with her boyfriend and when I asked she said she was thinking of breaking it off, but was reluctant as she didn't like change and hoped it would just work out. She's an optimist like that. But from the things she said, their relationship had just fizzled out. \n\nA few weeks ago we were having a late night deep conversation and I told her that I was falling for her. She told me she cared for me to, but timing wasn't exactly great. I gave her suggestions on what she could do when she broke up with her boyfriend. Accommodation ideas and things like that. She was quiet and distant, not her usual self. I think she was just afraid of being alone. \n\nA few days later I told her I loved her, and asked her if she loved me to. We were skyping and she nodded. Our conversation ended shortly after and she promised me we'd discuss to more tomorrow. \n\nI got a message later that night saying that she couldn't do this. She said she cared about me but felt some of her feelings might be whatever she thought would make me happy. I tried to talk to her more but she said she didn't think we should speak anymore and blocked me on Skype. \n\nAs far as I know, she is still with her boyfriend.

After I've been eating healthy for a few weeks in a row, I notice that my body doesn't feel anything from eating. it just feels...neutral. \n\nAfter a lifetime of emotional eating, of getting all my feelings from the food I eat, I miss feeling something after I eat. Eating a ton of pizza feels great. Feeling full feels great. Eating fresh cookies feels great. Eating ice cream feels great. At least for a while.\n\nBut when I'm eating healthy I feel nothing. So I'll usually go back to eating junk food because I miss feeling those feelings. \n\nSo here's the epiphany:\n\nNeutral should be your body's default feeling after food. You should get your physical highs by exercising rather than eating. \n\nIt's tough to overcome a lifetime of conditioning, but you should be shooting to feel nothing after eating. Or maybe some kind of palate satiation; the good feeling shouldn't be in a full belly. That's the goal. You can then use that unobstructed body to go to the gym or for a walk. \n\nThis blew my mind when I realized it, so I thought I would share. Good luck!",

When we got back to my place (he was staying with me for the weekend) it all went downhill. The only symptom I had/have was the vomiting but it was pretty much non-stop for 8 hours. \n\nI also hate being sick. After a few throw ups I started to cry and I'm sure that didn't help the situation. \n\nHe was really sweet. He sat behind me the whole time and rubbed my back and tummy and carried me to bed when it slowed down.

But it's been eating at me and I'm turning into an asshole full of resentment. I feel that it's a burden that I do not want to bear and it's making me unhappy. I wanted to travel places with her, and that's not going to happen for a long time now. Lots of things are on hold. I'm having this strong urge to end it and go on with my life without having to support another person any longer.\n\nShe's a wonderful woman and I love her very much. There's a part of me that has grown to resent the fact that she has not established a career or has been able to hold a steady job and contribute financially. I pay for everything. When we go on trips, I make sure it's all taken care of. But when I want to travel without her, either because I can't afford both of us, she gives me a hard time about it. For example, I had my yearly trip planned to go home for a couple of weeks and see my family (I'm a transplant) and she was upset that I didn't ask her to come with.",

My older sister had a problem with drugs, as did the babys father. My mother raised him as best she could, but she had Huntington's Disease. She inherited it from her mother. She was diagnosed and the symptoms started coming on pretty strong. She had a will drawn up that would protect her and her kids, including her adopted son. The trust was set up so that he would be taken care of until he turns 25. At the time, he was about 7. About a year after the will was prepared, the state took the child away from her. She spent years obsessed with him and tried to get him back through the courts, but they stripped her of her parental rights and he was adopted again. Shortly after that, other legal matters came to light and she turned her attention away from my nephew and on to other things. She didn't see him at all for about 5 1/2 years before she passed away. He is now 15, and my mothers lawyer is saying that all of the assets of the family are to be held in trust, and all income from rental property is to be used for his benefit until he is 25. \n\nSo now after throwing away my career to spend years helping my disabled mother I am left with nothing for the next decade while every last dime the estate makes goes to him. Of course, the will stipulates that I cannot apportion my share, contest the will or anything like that without losing my inheritance.\n\nIs it worth it to try to get a lawyer of my own to try to throw out the will on the grounds of her being unfit due to illness? Am I just fucked? I know it is unlikely that they would throw it out, but I really don't have any suitable alternatives. I pretty much gave up everything I had to help my mother make ends meet and help her with her day to day needs.",
