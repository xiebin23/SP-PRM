If the brush is too big for the mane, try a thinner one or cutting it shorter.  If the brush is too stiff and doesn\u2019t hold its shape, try a softer brush or softer bristles.  Once the brush is in place, you can brush with the same motion that you would use to brush hair.  If there are burrs or knots in the mane, you can use a comb with tines to work them out, taking your time, and checking as you go.  As for length, depending on where you want the mane to fall, you can choose different lengths of the mane to keep.  If you brush carefully with a wide-toothed comb, you may be able to comb it out fully, and then trim it to the desired length.  If you aren\u2019t comfortable doing so, you can choose to comb the mane out partially, and then let it fall out naturally.  If you\u2019re going for a certain look, you may even want to comb some parts out short, and some parts out long.",

        "content": "That\u2019s a great question!  You can reach behind the horse\u2019s neck and use a brush to apply downward pressure, pulling the mane taut against the scalp.  If the brush is too big for the mane, try a thinner one or cutting it shorter.  If the brush is too stiff and doesn\u2019t hold its shape, try a softer brush or softer bristles.  Once the brush is in place, you can brush with the same motion that you would use to brush hair.  If there are burrs or knots in the mane, you can use a comb with tines to work them out, taking your time, and checking as you go.  As for length, depending on where you want the mane to fall, you can choose different lengths of the mane to keep.  If you brush carefully with a wide-toothed comb, you may be able to comb it out fully, and then trim it to the desired length.  If you aren\u2019t comfortable doing so, you can choose to comb the mane out partially, and then let it fall out naturally.  If you\u2019re going for a certain look, you may even want to comb some parts out short, and some parts out long.",

And if you have a good sense of what\u2019s going on in your audience, this can be really helpful for making the magic tricks look convincing.

Gravity pulls things together, so that means that if you were to see an apple floating in space you would know that there must be another object present that it\u2019s being attracted to. So gravity acts like a force, but it\u2019s actually like an elastic band that pulls things together, and if you apply enough force to the apple it\u2019ll start to move towards the other object. You might think that if gravity only acted on solid objects it wouldn\u2019t be very powerful, but it\u2019s actually extremely powerful because it acts on anything that has mass, which means that it could act on light objects or even the energy present in photons or electrons.

It\u2019s difficult to describe this without just resorting to the fact that matter attracts other matter. Gravity is also incredibly weak, so it\u2019s not surprising that so many of the behaviors we associate with gravity come from Newton\u2019s laws of motion. The best known and simplest of these is \u201cF=ma\u201d, which says that if an object has a mass of m, and it is accelerating at a rate a, then it will have an attractive force acting on it from every other object with a mass of m (and any force exerted on them by some other object) of: F = ma. This would apply for example, to a person standing on the ground on Earth: the ground exerts an attractive force on the person that equals their weight, or mg. The gravitational force from the earth is then offset by the normal reaction force, or \u2018normal\u2019 force, due to the way the person is standing.",

It\u2019s probably the bacteria growing inside that causes the smell.  To prevent this, you\u2019ll want to keep food out of your trash, and wash your trash can with soap and water to help discourage bacteria.  And, you could put your trash can outside or remove the bag inside.  I could also tell you what\u2019s happening chemically in the trash, but I don\u2019t think this will help much.  Here\u2019s what I know:  If you smell something very strong, it\u2019s likely caused by bacteria.  The smelly gas in your trash can is produced by bacteria living on the surface of the trash, and is called \u201chydrogen sulfide\u201d.
